# Web Development Project 5 - *Data Dashboard Part 1*

Submitted by: **Jessie Estrada**

This web app: **This webpage accesses a public API and constructs a dashboard view of the data. The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered. In specific, this website uses the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) by Purina to provide a dashboard view of different dogs available for adoption.**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - [x] *The representation of the most common age group (Mode) in the results for the dogs showcased by the website*
  - [x] *The total results returned by the API. In other words, the user can quickly see how many results (Dog's) were returned*
  - [x] *The most popular breed (Mode) in the results returned.* 
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Some of the challenges I faced with this project, was working with this API in spcific. I had to request an access token through OAuth secure authentication. Organizing the website was also difficult since there were multiple pieces going into this website.
